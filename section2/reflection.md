## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* Something that was newer to me was the idea that "problem solving takes place within reach of one's capabilities". I don't need to worry about problems outside of my scope. There will be challenges, but not something like attempting an open heart surgery (something I have no knowledge on). Instead, the problems I will be facing as a programmer will be just beyond what I already know, so I can apply past experience to reach up, learn, and solve the problem. This idea along with the growth mindset will help me to grow my experience.
* Another point from the article I found interesting was S.M.A.R.T., or Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound goals. I've followed a similar method of goal setting in the past but never applied an acronym to it. There is always the greater project to be completed, but breaking that down into smaller achievable components makes it manageable and increases the quality of the output.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* One way that I believe I already demonstrate a Growth Mindset is by seeking out challenges. I'm constantly asking myself, "how do I do that?", and pushing myself to create something better even if its new or challenging. However, an area that I lack in is seeking help. I know with past problems I have spent way too much time trying to problem solve on my own before reaching out for help. I enjoy finding the solution for myself, but am working to approach my new career path with an open mindset and the questions things more easily (and quickly).

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
* I moved a little bit slower, because I had to double/triple check some of the things I was doing. It made me try things without direction which was uncomfortable at first, but forced me to learn by memorizing and paying closer attention.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
* A conditional statement is used to perform a certain action if certain criteria are met. A daily life example for me is, `if it is a weekend or holiday, then no morning alarm. Else, my alarm wakes me up at 7:30am`. An example of a conditional statement in web application could be `if username and password match, then allow access. Else, "wrong information" message is displayed`.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
* Multiple conditions are added by using `else if` with a requirement and possible action to take if that requirement is met. A program reads this by going through each condition until one is met, and then following the action outlined.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
* Logical Operators. AND Operations `&&`, are used to see if two conditions are met. OR Operations `||`, are used to check if at least one of the conditions is met.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
* I am still a little fuzzy on how to use logical operators. For example, in the last coding exercise in the if-statements.js file, I achieved the desired result using two different methods. But were either of those methods the best method? Could I run into issues later on if I don't follow a particular structure?
