## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I tend to wait too long most the time. I love to find the solution for myself if I think its possible. With that being said, this is a totally new skill I'm learning, so I am trying to approach this in a vulnerable way and ask as many questions as I can to get in the rhythm.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
* Number - a data type that is made up of numbers, including negative numbers and decimals. i,e `54` or `-70`
* String - a data type that is made up of letters or characters. String data uses quotes, i.e `"I am a string"`
* Boolean - a data type that assesses if something is true or false. JavaScript has a logic to determine how different sets of data are compared. A simple example would be `3 < 4 : true.`

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```JAVASCRIPT
console.log("Hello World!");
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
```JAVASCRIPT
// two backlashes before a single line of text will make it a comment
/* or you use an asterisk and slash combo around your text */
```
The purpose of the comment is to have the ability to write information (like instructions or notes) in your code without it interfering with the code itself. It can be helpful when looking back or to other developers.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a declared value that we can use throughout the code. It can represent many things. An example of a variable could be `age`. What age equals would depend on what we assign it.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
```JAVASCRIPT
var username = "u/JoeRupp"; //string
var darkMode = 1 > 0; //boolean
var redditAge = 5; //number
```

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is the process of joining different data sets together using the `+`. It is a way to connect variables of different types to make a 'correct' output. For example, concatenation allows the combination of numbers and strings.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
Anywhere a site greets you. For example, some sites/apps will display a message saying something like "Good morning, Joe". The first part of that message would depend on the time of day and the second part would be the username.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Would toggling something on or off be considered a boolean data type? For example, my above answer in number 6, `var darkMode = 1 > 0`, and if it's toggled on (or true) then dark mode is activated?
